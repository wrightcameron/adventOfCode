# Advent of Code 2023

## Requirements

- Rust
- rust-analyzer VSCode Extension(Debugging)

## Build

Rust Cargo crates don't require Rust to be compiled before it's run.  Instead building and running can be done with one command with `cargo run`.

`cargo check` & `cargo build`

## Running

```bash
cargo run -- [-e --each] [-d --day <DAY>] [-i --init]
```

### Environmental Variables

Logging can be enables by setting `RUST_LOG=debug`

## Resources

- [Rust Logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/)
